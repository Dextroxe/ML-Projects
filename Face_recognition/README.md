##Face recognition using OpenCV with haarcascade

#prerequisite
- First put the .jpg or .png image on hte *find_me* folder.

#Navigate person
- Then navigate *take_face.py* to edit the variable called **personFileName** with the new_image_.jpg & assign a **face_id** then run

#Training model
- navigate to *face_train* and run the program (DON'T EDIT ANYTHING)

#Predict model
- finally navigate to *face_recog.py* to edit the variable called **predictName** with the new_image_.jpg and run to predict XD
(on the *face_recog.py* you can need to add the {id} : {name} on the this dictionary so that it can identify person name with it's id which you have assign)
